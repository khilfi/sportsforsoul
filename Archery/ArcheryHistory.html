          <h1 class="title">History</h1>
          <p class="intro">Archery is one of the oldest arts still practised today. The evolution of archery began at the start of mankind’s history, and evidence of ancient archers has been found around the world. Although archery probably dates to the Stone Age – around 20,000BC – the earliest people known to have regularly used bows and arrows were the Ancient Egyptians, who adopted archery around 3,000BC for hunting and warfare. and for at least 10,000 years archery was an important military and hunting skill, and features prominently in the mythologies of many cultures. Archers, whether on foot, in chariots or on horseback were a major part of most militaries until about 1500 when they began to be replaced by firearms, first in Europe, and then progressively elsewhere. Archery continues to be a popular sport; most commonly in the form of target archery, but in some places also for hunting.</p>

          <p class="history-essay"><img class="history-image" src="archerychina.jpg" alt="">In China, the earliest evidence of archery dates to the Shang Dynasty – 1766-1027BC. A war chariot of that time carried a three-man team, a driver, a lancer and an archer. During the Zhou (Chou) Dynasty that followed – 1027-256BC – nobles at court attended archery tournaments that were accompanied my music and interspersed with entertainment. When Chinese people introduced Japan to archery in the sixth century it had an overwhelming influence on culture.</p>

          <p class="history-essay"><img class="history-image" src="archeryjapan.jpg" alt="">One of Japan’s most well-known martial arts, originally known as “kyujutsu” (the art of the bow), is known as “kyudo” (the way of the bow). Modern kyudo is practised primarily for physical, moral and spiritual development. After certain ritual movements, a kyudo archer steps onto the shooting line to shoot at a target 36cm in diameter, 28 metres away, set in a roofed bank of sand. The kyudo bow is 2.21 metres long and made of laminated strips of bamboo.</p>

          <p class="history-essay"><img class="history-image" src="archeryrome.jpg" alt="">In the Greco-Roman period, archers in both warfare and hunting settings were frequently shown on pottery. The people of Crete practiced archery and Cretan mercenary archers were in great demand.[20] Crete was known for its unbroken tradition of archery. The Geek god Apollo is the god of archery, also of plague and the sun, metaphorically perceived as shooting invisible arrows, Artemis the goddess of hunting. Heracles and Odysseus and other mythological figures are often depicted with a bow. During the invasion of India, Alexander the Great personally took command of the shield-bearing guards, foot-companions, archers, Agrianians and horse-javelin-men and led them against the Kamboja clans—the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus (Panjkora) valley, and the Assakenois of the Swat and Buner valleys. The early Romans had very few archers, if any. As their empire grew, they recruited auxiliary archers from other nations. Julius Caesar's armies in Gaul included Cretan archers, and Vercingetorix his enemy ordered "all the archers, of whom there was a very great number in Gaul, to be collected". By the 4th century, archers with powerful composite bows were a regular part of Roman armies throughout the empire. After the fall of the western empire, the Romans came under severe pressure from the highly skilled mounted archers belonging to the Hun invaders, and later Eastern Roman armies relied heavily on mounted archery.</p>

          <p class="history-essay"><img class="history-image" src="archerymiddleeast.jpg" alt="">Middle Eastern superiority in archery equipment and technique reigned for centuries. With bows like those of the Assyrians and Parthians, who were probably the first to master archery from horseback, Attila the Hun and his Mongols conquered much of Europe and Asia, and Turkish archers threw back the Crusaders.</p>

          <p class="history-essay"><img class="history-image" src="archeryenglish.jpg" alt="">The English longbow became a force in the middle ages and was used in many famous European battles such as Crécy and Agincourt. A law in England that forced every man of adult age to practise archery every Sunday was never repealed, though it is presently ignored. The first-known archery competition relatable to modern times was held in Finsbury, England in 1583 and had 3,000 participants.</p>

          <p class="history-essay">Archery is featured in folklore around the world, Robin Hood being probably the most famous. Based in Nottingham forest, he used his bow to steal from the rich and give to the poor, while combating the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. In modern literature and films, elf Legolas in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the Green Arrow in TV series Archer and Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games series have all been credited with boosting archery’s popularity, especially with younger generations. Odysseus, who returned home to Ithaca after 20 years at war in the Greek epic The Odyssey, was also an excellent archer. He was the only one to be able to draw his bow and shoot an arrow through 12 rings to claim back his wife, Penelope, and fend off a host of suitors.</p>
